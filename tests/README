Edit config.inc prior to running the tests.

Four MySQL servers are required for running *all* tests:

  1) replication master
  2) replication slave

Master and slave must be configured as a replication cluster. Replication
must be up and running.

  3) emulated replication master
  4) emulated replication slave

The emulated master and slave must not be setup as a replication cluster.
Those servers are used whenever asynchronous replication could give false
positives or errors are simulated which would break the replication stream.

Most tests use the emulated server pair. Only few need the replication server
pair. Some tests can be run with only one physical server as both emulated master
and emulated slave, Some tests don't need MySQL at all.

All configured hosts must use the same user, password settings.
Using host[:port|socket] you can set the port respectively socket of the
master and slave server. If not give, MYSQL_TEST_SOCKET and MYSQL_TEST_PORT
are used.

MYSQL_TEST_MASTER_HOST="localhost"
MYSQL_TEST_SLAVE_HOST="localhost"

Example using host[:port|socket] syntax:

MYSQL_TEST_MASTER_HOST="127.0.0.1:3307"
MYSQL_TEST_SLAVE_HOST="localhost:/tmp/mysql2.sock"
